implement the TD-Learning algorithm for policy evaluation and use it to construct an estimate, vˆ, of the value function of the optimal policy, π∗, for the 687-Gridworld.
Reported the average value function estimated by the algorithm. 
Reported the average and the standard deviation of the number of episodes needed for the algorithm to converge.
The Max-Norm between this average value function and the optimal value function for the 687-Gridworld domain was calculated as well.
